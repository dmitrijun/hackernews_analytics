# Test — Data Engineer

## Intro

Welcome to the test exercise for Data Engineer position at ⚪️ White Circle

Process:

- Start recording your screen
- Complete the task
- Send results to [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] on Telegram — it’s not really important how you do this, it can be Google Drive or .zip or GitHub or whatever is convenient

Rules:

- You can use *anything* to complete the task in the best way possible — you can google whatever you want, you can use ANY tool (ie Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, whatever), etc
- You must complete this exercise in 1 hour
- Do not forget to record your screen
- You should complete as many sub-tasks as possible
- Bonus point if you write any form of documentation in the process or just say out loud something about implementation

## Goal

A company is trying to figure out what is the best strategy to post on HackerNews, and if it actually has an impact on meaningful metrics.

Your goal is to write a scraper of HackerNews and GitHub. You can limit yourself for the last 6 months of data — bonus point if it works for more.

Your another goal is to conduct some exploratory data analysis on top!

## Questions

1. In general, how many posts are related to AI over time on HackerNews?
2. What is the right time and day to post?
3. Is there a best way to write a title for a post?
4. Can you create a set of rules on writing good title to reuse later in ChatGPT?
5. Does carma of people that comment posts correlate with the upvote count?
6. What performs better — Twitter links or GitHub links?
7. What is the impact of successful YC launches on GitHub stars count?
Note: you should find out how many stars were there at the moment of YC launches
8. Write a short summary of your findings + ways to improve the things you just implemented
9. Can we detect patterns of reposts (same GitHub/Twitter/Blog link shared multiple times) and evaluate whether reposts perform better or worse than first-time submissions?
10. How does the comment activity (number of comments and length of discussions) correlate with the final upvote count of HackerNews posts?
